I've spent a small about of time talking about things that aren't work-related, usually at a thing called Bettakultcha (think Peta Kucha, but with a Yorkshire accent).

These are the examples I've been able to find, but I know there were a lot more that have, over the years, succumbed to history. You'd need to imagine my talks on the science and history of cake, the perils awaiting future archaeologists, pinhole photography using canal boats, matchboxes and syrup tins, and Skinner boxes and the power of superstition. They were great talks and I still have the slide decks, but actual evidence is sadly lacking.
