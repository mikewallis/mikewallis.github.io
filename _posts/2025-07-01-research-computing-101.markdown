Research computing isn't the province of people in black hoodies sat in basements staring at green WYSE terminals any more, it's literally anything that involves computers and research, which these days is literally all research. Designing a psychology experiment? Computer. Coming up with a nutritional plan for athletics? Computer. Literature searches? Computer. It's not just protein folding, climate mapping and fluid dynamics, it's GIS, it's corpus analytics, it's <i>information is beautiful</i> -type visualisations.

And, yes, it's also supercomputers with clever interconnects and weird parallel storage.

But don't make the mistake of thinking you have to do this in isolation, too. Getting the research done is only the next bit; first you need to get your research framework in place. Pipelines, data management plans, ethics approval are all part of it, as well as working out what software you need.

I've seen people not do novel research because they can't get the software working on their own laptops, and I'd like to help users get over that first hurdle. I can't do your research for you, but I can at least try to get you in a position where you can.
