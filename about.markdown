Mike is not really a fan of LinkedIn or most forms of social media. You might find him on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@nalsa) but honestly that's usually only a front for [Daylightbot](https://github.com/mikewallis/daylightbot). He used to do [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nalsa/). Spent a lot of time in Leeds and Edinburgh. Has a lot more hobbies than you'd expect. Makes chocolates.
